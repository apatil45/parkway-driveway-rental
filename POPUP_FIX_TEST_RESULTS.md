# 🎯 Multiple Popups Fix - Test Results

## ✅ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

### **🔍 Original Issue**
- **Problem**: Multiple popups appearing simultaneously when clicking on different parking slots
- **Root Cause**: Leaflet's default behavior allows multiple popups to be open at the same time
- **User Impact**: Confusing UI with overlapping popups, poor user experience

### **🛠️ Solution Implemented**

#### **1. Created Popup Management Hook (`usePopupManager.ts`)**
- ✅ **Global State Management**: Tracks currently open popup
- ✅ **Auto-Close Logic**: Automatically closes previous popup when new one opens
- ✅ **Event Handlers**: Manages popup open/close events
- ✅ **Reusable**: Can be used across different map components

#### **2. Updated MapMarker Component**
- ✅ **Integrated Hook**: Uses `usePopupManager` for popup control
- ✅ **Event Management**: Proper popup open/close event handling
- ✅ **Marker Click**: Closes other popups when marker is clicked
- ✅ **Ref Management**: Uses refs to track popup instances

#### **3. Updated RealMapView Component**
- ✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Same popup management across all map views
- ✅ **Event Handlers**: Integrated popup management events
- ✅ **Marker Interaction**: Closes other popups on marker click

### **🎯 Key Features of the Fix**

#### **Single Popup Management**
```typescript
// Before: Multiple popups could be open simultaneously
// After: Only one popup open at a time
const { popupRef, handlePopupOpen, handlePopupClose, handleMarkerClick } = usePopupManager();
```

#### **Automatic Popup Closure**
```typescript
// When a new popup opens, previous ones are automatically closed
const handlePopupOpen = useCallback(() => {
  closeAllPopups(); // Close any existing popup
  currentOpenPopup = popupRef.current; // Set new popup as current
}, []);
```

#### **Marker Click Management**
```typescript
// When marker is clicked, close other popups first
const handleMarkerClick = useCallback(() => {
  closeAllPopups(); // Ensure clean state
}, []);
```
