## 🛠️ **FINAL FIXES APPLIED**

### **1. Backend CSP Configuration Fix**
**Problem**: Backend helmet configuration was too restrictive, blocking Stripe.js

**Solution**: Updated `index.js` helmet configuration:
```javascript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "'unsafe-eval'", "https://js.stripe.com", "https://checkout.stripe.com"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", "https://api.stripe.com", "https://checkout.stripe.com", "ws://localhost:3000", "wss:"],
      fontSrc: ["'self'", "https://fonts.gstatic.com"],
      objectSrc: ["'none'"],
      mediaSrc: ["'self'"],
      frameSrc: ["'self'", "https://js.stripe.com", "https://checkout.stripe.com"],
      workerSrc: ["'self'", "blob:"],
      formAction: ["'self'"],
    },
  },
  // ... other security settings
}));
```

**Result**: Stripe.js can now load from backend ✅

---

### **2. Missing Screenshot File Fix**
**Problem**: Backend was missing `/screenshots/desktop-home.png` file

**Solution**: Created placeholder PNG file in `public/screenshots/desktop-home.png`

**Result**: No more 404 errors for missing screenshot ✅

---

### **3. Server Restart with Fixes**
**Problem**: Old server configuration was still running

**Solution**: 
- Killed all Node.js processes
- Restarted backend server with new CSP configuration
- Rebuilt frontend with all fixes

**Result**: All fixes are now active ✅
