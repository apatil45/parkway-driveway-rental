# 🧪 Testing Results - Multiple Booking Forms Fix

## ✅ **TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

### **🔍 Problem Identified**
- **Issue**: Multiple booking forms appearing when clicking on multiple slots in the map
- **Root Cause**: Both `ParkwayInterface` and `DriverDashboardNew` had independent `showBookingModal` state
- **Impact**: Poor user experience with overlapping modals and confusing interface

### **🛠️ Solution Implemented**

#### **1. Global Booking Context (`BookingContext.tsx`)**
- ✅ **Created**: Centralized state management for booking modal
- ✅ **Features**: Multi-slot selection, smart slot management, global actions
- ✅ **Benefits**: Single source of truth, prevents state conflicts

#### **2. Unified Booking Modal (`UnifiedBookingModal.tsx`)**
- ✅ **Created**: Single modal instance replacing multiple modals
- ✅ **Features**: Multi-slot display, smart time suggestions, payment integration
- ✅ **Benefits**: Better UX, cleaner interface, enhanced functionality

#### **3. Component Refactoring**
- ✅ **ParkwayInterface**: Removed local booking state, uses global context
- ✅ **DriverDashboardNew**: Removed duplicate booking modal, uses unified system
- ✅ **App.tsx**: Added BookingProvider wrapper for global state

#### **4. Enhanced Styling**
- ✅ **CSS Updates**: Added styles for selected slots section
